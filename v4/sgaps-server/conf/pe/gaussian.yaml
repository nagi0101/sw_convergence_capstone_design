# Gaussian Fourier Features (Learnable RFF)
type: gaussian_fourier
# Bandwidth for Gaussian sampling
# Higher sigma = Higher frequencies = Better local detail (but less global structure)
# Increased from 10.0 to 30.0 for "Local Relationship" learning
sigma: 30.0       # Initial bandwidth for Gaussian frequency sampling
learnable: true   # Whether frequency matrix is learnable
