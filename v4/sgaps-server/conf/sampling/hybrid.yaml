# Hybrid Sampling Configuration
# Phase 3: Multi-strategy sampling with importance + uniform + random

pattern: "hybrid"

# Sample count constraints
default_sample_count: 3000
min_sample_count: 250
max_sample_count: 3000

# Multi-strategy composition
# Note: Current implementation uses importance + uniform (2 strategies)
# Future versions may support the 3-strategy approach below
strategies:
    - name: "importance_based"
      weight: 0.6
      method: "attention_entropy"
    - name: "uniform_grid"
      weight: 0.3
    - name: "random"
      weight: 0.1

# Importance calculation settings (for importance-based strategy)
importance:
    method: "attention_entropy"
    epsilon: 1.0e-9
    normalize: true

# Sampling distribution (currently active implementation)
distribution:
    importance_ratio: 0.6 # 60% from high-importance regions
    uniform_ratio: 0.4 # 40% uniform coverage

# Update behavior
update:
    frequency: 1 # Update sampling every N frames
    warmup_frames: 10 # Use uniform sampling for first N frames
