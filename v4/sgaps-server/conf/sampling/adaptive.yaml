# Adaptive Importance-based Sampling Configuration
# Phase 3: Attention entropy-driven adaptive pixel sampling

pattern: "adaptive_importance"

# Sample count constraints
default_sample_count: 500
min_sample_count: 250
max_sample_count: 1000

# Importance calculation settings
importance:
    method: "attention_entropy"  # Shannon entropy of attention distribution
    epsilon: 1.0e-9              # Numerical stability for log calculations
    normalize: true              # Normalize importance map to [0, 1]

# Sampling distribution strategy
distribution:
    importance_ratio: 0.6  # 60% from high-importance regions
    uniform_ratio: 0.4     # 40% uniform coverage (prevent overfitting)

# Update behavior
update:
    frequency: 1            # Update sampling every N frames (1 = every frame)
    warmup_frames: 10       # Use uniform sampling for first N frames (cold start)
