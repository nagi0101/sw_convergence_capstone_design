# Game Session Replay using Masked Autoencoder: A comprehensive model architecture

## Model architecture design with hierarchical spatial-temporal processing

The proposed architecture combines innovations from VideoMAE V2, hierarchical vision transformers, and multi-modal fusion techniques to create a specialized system for game session replay. The core design leverages a **Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Masked Autoencoder (HST-MAE)** that processes masked images from game sessions while incorporating state vectors for enhanced reconstruction.

### Core architecture components

**Input processing pipeline**: The system accepts two primary input streams: (1) masked game frames with 90-95% occlusion following tube masking patterns, and (2) state vectors containing camera position, character position, and other game parameters. Input frames are divided into 3D spatiotemporal cubes of 2×16×16 pixels, reducing dimensionality from T×H×W to (T/2)×(H/16)×(W/16) tokens.

**Hierarchical encoder structure**: Building on Swin Transformer principles, the encoder employs shifted window attention for linear computational complexity O(N) instead of O(N²). The architecture consists of four hierarchical stages with progressively reduced spatial resolution and increased channel capacity:

- Stage 1: 768-dim, 56×56 resolution (early high-resolution for spatial detail)
- Stage 2: 1024-dim, 28×28 resolution (intermediate features)
- Stage 3: 1280-dim, 14×14 resolution (semantic features)
- Stage 4: 1408-dim, 7×7 resolution (global context)

**Dual masking strategy**: Following VideoMAE V2, the system implements dual masking with encoder masking at 90-95% and decoder masking at 50% using running cell patterns. This achieves 1.48× speedup and ~50% memory reduction while maintaining reconstruction quality.

**Multi-modal fusion module**: State vectors undergo encoding through a separate MLP network, then fuse with visual features via cross-attention mechanisms. The fusion occurs at multiple hierarchical levels using the formula:
```
Attention(Q_visual, K_state, V_state) = softmax(Q_visual × K_state^T / √d_k) × V_state
```

**Region-aware spatial modeling**: To handle multiple spatial regions within games, the architecture incorporates region embeddings similar to position encodings. Each spatial region receives a learnable embedding vector that modulates the attention computation, allowing the model to distinguish between high-similarity intra-region patches and lower-similarity inter-region patches.

## Training strategy with masked image constraints

### Progressive curriculum learning approach

Training follows a three-phase curriculum learning strategy adapted from CL-MAE:

**Phase 1 - Easy reconstruction** (epochs 1-400): The masking module generates masks focusing on less informative regions, allowing the model to learn basic reconstruction from easier examples. Masking ratio starts at 85% and gradually increases to 90%.

**Phase 2 - Balanced learning** (epochs 401-800): Neutral masking with random patterns across all spatial regions. The model learns to leverage both spatial similarity within regions and state vector information for reconstruction.

**Phase 3 - Adversarial refinement** (epochs 801-1200): Challenging masks targeting semantically important regions force the model to develop robust representations. State vectors become crucial for disambiguating difficult reconstructions.

### Loss function formulation

The multi-objective loss combines several components with dynamic weighting:

```
L_total = λ_recon × L_reconstruction + λ_spatial × L_spatial_consistency + 
          λ_temporal × L_temporal_coherence + λ_state × L_state_alignment
```

Where:
- L_reconstruction: MSE between predicted and original patches (weight: 1.0)
- L_spatial_consistency: Enforces similarity within spatial regions (weight: 0.3)
- L_temporal_coherence: Maintains consistency across time steps (weight: 0.2)
- L_state_alignment: Ensures state vectors align with visual predictions (weight: 0.1)

### Optimization parameters

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with β₁=0.9, β₂=0.95
- **Learning rate**: 1.5e-4 with cosine decay and 40-epoch warmup
- **Batch size**: 256 for base model, 64 for large model
- **Weight decay**: 0.05
- **Gradient clipping**: 1.0 for training stability

## Encoding and decoding pipeline for efficient storage

### Compression architecture

The system employs **Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)** with hierarchical codebooks for maximum compression efficiency:

**Codebook configuration**:
- 6 hierarchical codebooks with 512 entries each
- Exponential capacity: 512^6 possible quantizations
- Bit allocation: 54 bits per spatiotemporal cube (9 bits × 6 codebooks)
- Achieves 35-49× compression ratio compared to raw storage

**Encoding pipeline**:
1. Encoder outputs continuous latent representations Z
2. First codebook quantizes Z → q₁, residual r₁ = Z - q₁
3. Sequential quantization of residuals through remaining codebooks
4. Store only codebook indices (54 bits) instead of full features (8192 bits)

**Decoding pipeline**:
1. Retrieve codebook vectors from stored indices
2. Sum quantized vectors: Z_reconstructed = Σ(q_i)
3. Lightweight decoder (4 transformer blocks) reconstructs patches
4. State vectors guide reconstruction through cross-attention

### Storage optimization strategies

- **Entropy coding**: Further compress codebook indices using arithmetic coding
- **Temporal delta encoding**: Store differences between consecutive frames
- **Keyframe intervals**: Full encoding every 16-32 frames, deltas between
- **Adaptive bit allocation**: More bits for high-motion sequences

## Leveraging spatial similarity within sessions

### Spatial coherence modeling

The architecture exploits spatial similarity through **Region-Aware Attention (RAA)** mechanisms:

**Intra-region processing**: Within each spatial region, patches share attention biases that encourage information exchange. The attention matrix incorporates spatial proximity:
```
A_spatial = A_base + λ_proximity × exp(-||pos_i - pos_j||² / σ²)
```

**Cross-region connections**: Limited cross-region attention (25% of connections) maintains global coherence while respecting regional boundaries.

**Spatial memory banks**: Each region maintains a memory bank of representative features updated via exponential moving average. During reconstruction, these banks provide additional context through memory-augmented attention.

### Session-level consistency

**Temporal session modeling**: The model maintains session-level state through:
- Recurrent state propagation between frames
- Session-specific adaptation layers
- Temporal positional encodings reflecting actual time intervals

**Multi-view consistency**: For sessions from the same spatial point but different viewpoints, the model enforces consistency through contrastive losses between corresponding patches.

## Multi-region scenario handling

### Hierarchical region processing

The architecture implements a **three-level hierarchy** for multi-region games:

**Level 1 - Local patches**: Individual 16×16 pixel patches within regions
**Level 2 - Regional aggregation**: Region-specific feature pooling and processing
**Level 3 - Global context**: Game-wide feature integration

### Region-specific adaptation

**Adaptive masking ratios**: Different regions use different masking ratios based on visual complexity:
- Simple regions (sky, walls): 95% masking
- Complex regions (characters, objects): 85% masking
- Critical regions (UI, objectives): 75% masking

**Region embeddings**: Learnable 256-dimensional embeddings distinguish regions, added to patch embeddings before attention layers.

**Hierarchical decoding**: The decoder processes regions in order of importance, using previously decoded regions as additional context for subsequent regions.

## State vector integration approach

### Multi-modal fusion architecture

State vectors undergo sophisticated processing before fusion:

**State encoding network**:
```
1. Input projection: Linear(state_dim, 768)
2. Positional encoding: Sinusoidal embeddings for continuous values
3. State transformer: 4 layers with 8 attention heads
4. Output projection: Linear(768, encoder_dim)
```

**Fusion mechanisms**:
- **Early fusion**: Concatenated with visual tokens at input (10% of total)
- **Cross-attention fusion**: State queries attend to visual features at each encoder layer
- **Late fusion**: Final predictions combine visual and state branches

### State-guided reconstruction

State vectors provide crucial guidance during reconstruction:

**Camera-aware masking**: Masking patterns adapt based on camera position and viewing angle
**Motion-informed prediction**: Character velocity influences temporal reconstruction
**Context injection**: Game state (score, level, mode) modulates decoder behavior
